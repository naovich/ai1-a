      "content": "The article from the OpenAI Cookbook titled \"Processing and narrating a video with GPT's visual capabilities and the TTS API\" provides a guide on how to utilize GPT's capabilities for video understanding and narration. Here's a step-by-step overview of what the article covers:\n\n1. **Introduction**: The article explains that while GPT-4o cannot directly take video inputs, it can process static frames of a video to understand and describe it. This is achieved using vision capabilities and a 128K context window.\n\n2. **Video Frame Extraction**: It describes using OpenCV to extract frames from a video. For example, frames from a video of bisons and wolves are extracted. This process involves capturing the video, reading frames, encoding them into base64 format, and storing them for further processing.\n\n3. **Video Description**: The extracted frames are then used to craft a prompt for GPT-4o to generate a compelling description of the video. The example provided generates a description titled \"Epic Wildlife Showdown: Wolves vs. Bison in the Snow,\" describing the interaction between wolves and bison.\n\n4. **Voiceover Generation**: The article demonstrates how to create a voiceover script for the video using GPT-4o in the style of David Attenborough. It uses a similar process of prompting with selected frames to generate a narration script.\n\n5. **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Conversion**: Finally, the generated script is passed to the TTS API to produce an audio file (mp3) with the narration, completing the process of video understanding and narration.\n\nThe entire process showcases the integration of visual frame processing, natural language generation, and text-to-speech synthesis to enhance video content with descriptive and narrative elements.",
